# Learning classifier from dataset:
`version 1.0`  
1. All files generated by step one, divided according to image type are:
    * Read into memory
    * Resized into 28x28 pixel entities(2)
    * Paired with label according to their classification
1. Order of files in corresponding list are randomized
1. After steps 1. and 2. we have 4 separate sets of data according scan type
1. Lists of images are converted into np.arrays and then into matrices of data.
1. Data are subdivided into two sets:
    * 75% to learning
    * 25% to testing
1. We enhance data sets by (...)
1. Classifier models are compiled, trained, and serialized to disk
1. Classifier parameters are saved as `json` file into classifier directory.
